I am Arafat Mahmud. As a DevOps engineer currently interning at ShareTrip LTD, I am passionate about integrating development and operations to enhance the software development process. With a strong foundation in both software development and IT operations, I strive to bridge the gap between these two disciplines, fostering collaboration, efficiency, and continuous improvement.

During my internship at ShareTrip LTD, I am actively involved in automating infrastructure provisioning, deploying applications, and implementing CI/CD pipelines. I enjoy optimizing workflows and leveraging cutting-edge tools and technologies to streamline development and deployment processes, ultimately delivering high-quality software products.

As a quick learner and a team player, I actively seek opportunities to expand my knowledge and contribute to the success of the organization. My goal is to gain valuable hands-on experience in the DevOps field while working closely with experienced professionals to enhance my skills and make a positive impact on the company's technology initiatives.

Outside of work, I enjoy staying up-to-date with the latest industry trends, attending tech meetups, and engaging in open-source projects to give back to the community. I am excited to continue my journey as a DevOps engineer and make significant contributions to the success and growth of ShareTrip LTD.
